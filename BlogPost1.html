      <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Nairobi, Kenya – October 22, 2025 —</strong> Atlancis Technologies, Africa’s first Open Compute Project (OCP) Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), under the Servernah Cloud brand, announces the delivery and deployment of Africa’s first GPU-powered Artificial Intelligence (AI) factory, now hosted at iXAfrica Data Centre — Kenya’s leading AI-ready carrier-neutral facility. Partnering with Everse Technology to deliver end-to-end AI solutions, this milestone marks a historic leap in Africa’s digital evolution — a move from technology dependency to digital sovereignty — empowering enterprises, governments, and innovators to build, train, and deploy AI models within the continent’s borders. This milestone also serves as a catalyst for AI adoption and growth within the region by making GPUs locally accessible.</p>

      <h2>The Birth of African AI</h2>
      <p>Every revolution begins with a spark. Across Africa, ideas are abundant, but AI infrastructure is scarce — until now. Atlancis’ new GPU-powered AI-as-a-Service platform, built on Open Compute Project (OCP) design principles and powered by NVIDIA GPUs, delivers hyperscale compute performance engineered for Africa’s unique challenges. Delivered as a cloud service, the infrastructure is designed to accelerate high-performance computing, machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics workloads with unmatched scalability, energy efficiency, and sustainability.</p>

      <blockquote>“This is more than HPCs and GPUs — it’s the heart of Africa’s AI revolution,” said Daniel Njuguna, Founder and CEO of Atlancis Technologies. “We are proving that world-class innovation can be designed, built, and powered from within Africa.”</blockquote>

      <h2>Hosted at iXAfrica: The Engine Room of Innovation</h2>

      </div>
      <p>The infrastructure is hosted at iXAfrica’s NBOX1 campus, East Africa’s first hyperscale, AI-ready data centre offering customers power densities as high as 50 kW per rack. With its green-powered grid, carrier-neutral interconnectivity, and Tier III reliability, iXAfrica provides the optimal environment for AI workloads — ensuring high-density power, low-latency connectivity, and 99.999% uptime.</p>

      <blockquote>“At iXAfrica, we see this deployment as a defining step in Africa’s AI infrastructure story,” said Snehar Shah, CEO of iXAfrica Data Centre. “Partnerships like this are how we build the foundation for Africa’s intelligent future — locally powered and globally competitive.”</blockquote>

      <h2>Powering Africa’s Digital Future: Servernah Cloud Services</h2>
      <p>At the core of this transformation lies <strong>Servernah Cloud Services</strong> — Atlancis’ next-generation cloud platform purpose-built for African enterprises. Servernah delivers on-demand compute, storage, and GPU acceleration through an open, sovereign cloud infrastructure that gives organizations full control over their data and digital operations. Designed for scalability and cost efficiency, Servernah empowers businesses to innovate without borders — offering secure, locally hosted cloud solutions that support AI development, digital transformation, and sustainable growth across industries.</p>

      <h2>The Dawn of Africa’s Intelligent Future</h2>
      <p>The unique approach by all three partners sets up Africa to take on AI at cost while at scale — granting access for key sectors such as healthcare, food, financial services, startups, and even government. With AI becoming accessible and affordable, Africa can take the opportunity to chart its own path to adopt AI, leverage AI, and experiment with AI — gaining the most utility from local infrastructure.</p>

      <blockquote>“AI-ready infrastructure was always going to be the first step to unlocking Africa’s AI opportunity and setting us up to take more control of the intelligent future,” said Michael Michie, Co-founder and CEO of Everse Technology. “Through these partnerships we will see adoption rapidly scale upwards in all sectors.”</blockquote>

      <p><strong>It’s the first pulse of a new era — where innovation is built here, for here.</strong></p>
